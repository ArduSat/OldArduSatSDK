### Background ###
The old Ardusat has a new name: [Spire](http://www.spire.com/). [Ardusat](http://www.ardusat.com) has re-launched as an education tech company with an exclusive technology partnership with Spire. This library is an incomplete version of an old satellite SDK Spire (then Ardusat) was working on. The [new SDK](http://github.com/ArduSat/ArdusatSDK) is at the repository linked above.
